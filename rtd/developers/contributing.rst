Documentation
=============

We don’t want to settle for just making sure RVI SOTA is a great piece of software; we want it to be something that people are interesting in using, understanding, and contributing to. To that end, we strive to make these docs as clear, up-to-date, and comprehensive as possible. So if there’s anything you’re having trouble with, please don’t hesitate to engage with us on the `automotive-eg-rvi <https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/automotive-eg-rvi>`__ or `GENIVI Projects <http://lists.genivi.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/genivi-projects>`__ mailing list. Or if you want to contribute to the documentation directly, you’ll find the sources for the documentation site in rvi\_sota\_server/docs. The docs are written in Asciidoc format (syntax reference `here <http://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/>`__, but if you’re familiar with Markdown you’ll feel right at home), and rendered using `Jekyll <https://jekyllrb.com/>`__ and `Asciidoctor <http://asciidoctor.org/>`__.
